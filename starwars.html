            <br>
            <p>It is a period of civil wars in the galaxy. 
                A brave alliance of underground freedom fighters has
                 challenged the tyranny and oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Striking from a fortress
                 hidden among the billion stars
                  of the galaxy, rebel spaceships 
                  have won their first victory in 
                  a battle with the powerful Imperial 
                  Starfleet. The EMPIRE fears that another 
                  defeat could bring a thousand more solar 
                  systems into the rebellion, and Imperial 
                  control over the galaxy would be lost forever.</p>
                <br>
                <p>crush the rebellion once 
                    and for all, the EMPIRE 
                    is constructing a sinister
                     new battle station. Powerful
                      enough to destroy an entire
                       planet, its completion spells 
                       certain doom for the champions of freedom.</p>
